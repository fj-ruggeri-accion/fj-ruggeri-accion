- 👋 Hi, I’m @fj-ruggeri-accion
- 👀 I’m interested in having fun, primarily 🥳🥳 And then in many many things, from diverse areas. That's why I've inserted myself into the study of Multimedial Design, which provided me a pretty good dose of everything I was interested to: motion graphics, web design, graphic design, 3D modeling and animation, etc. Then I've expanded my knowledge in regards to what I considered the most fun, most interesting, and what I've needed the most for different reasons, like Python for Blender. I also make music! :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React Native with Expo Go, along with this awesome platform called Github, and more other things related to other areas such as Affinity Photo and Affinity Designer
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on every project that I can visualize my help, and also my growth
- 📫 How to reach me fj.ruggeri.accion@gmail.com
